This project is not just about building a sensor—it’s about solving a real-world problem efficiently and intelligently. Parking issues are a daily challenge, and by designing a system that works correctly and is easy to access, we are contributing to smarter, more convenient urban spaces. From hardware to software, every aspect matters, and our focus on accuracy, reliability, and usability ensures that our solution makes a difference. Challenges will come, but with teamwork, persistence, and innovation, we can turn this idea into a practical and impactful system. The future of smart parking starts here!
